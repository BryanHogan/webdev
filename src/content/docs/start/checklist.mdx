**WIP**

A checklist for you to go through for each website you build. âœ…

Each point is explained in detail throughout other sections of the site.

So what steps to follow to launch your website?

## Launching website checklist ðŸ“‹

`<Steps>`

- Think of content, what content should be included? Just in purely written form, what elements should make up the site?
- Group and rank elements, what belongs together and what is more important? Then start designs around the most important elements first.
- Create visual prototypes. Go from more abstract to more concrete. For more complex products this design process should look more intricate and iterative, but for simple websites this is enough.  
    First create the mobile view, then the desktop view. I like to use Figma for this.
- Setup project in code. (Keywords: Tech-stack, Git repo, IDE)
- Write outline of HTML.
- Create CSS variables. 
- Put online
- Favicon
- Sitemap
- Schema Markup - https://technicalseo.com/tools/schema-markup-generator/

- Finished build site? Time to test some things.
    1. Optimize images and page speed.
    2. Validate HTML at [validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org/).
    3. Check your links. You don't want 404's or errors in your links. I use [drlinkcheck.com](https://www.drlinkcheck.com/)
    4. Lighthouse check. `Accessibility`, `Best Practices` and `SEO` should all be at a 100, `Performance` should be near 100.
    5. Test page speed on something like [pagespeed.web.dev](https://pagespeed.web.dev/).
    7. Test on multiple devices and browsers.
    6. Adding analytics. If you want advanced insights into user behaviour on your site add an analystics tool like Google Analytics or choose less intrusive options like Matomo, Umami or Plausible.
    8. Add site to the [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about).
