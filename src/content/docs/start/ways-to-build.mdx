Since there are various needs when it comes to having and building a website I want to highlight that developing your own website might not always be the best option for your situation. There are various ways you can create a website.

The 3 main ways to build a website are:

1. Website builders
2. Content management systems (CMS)
3. Custom coded

Website builders are more simple but lack in customizability. Custom coded is the most complex but gives you full freedom and thus more room for optimization. (The term website builder and CMS is used interchangeably in the following text.)

But even for each category there are a multitude of options that each have different use cases.

Want to build your own online shop? ➡️ Shopify  
Visual website builder that feels like Figma for designers ➡️ Webflow or Framer or Builder.io  
E-Mail newsletter based ➡️ Substack or Beehiiv or Buttondown  
Very simple and very basic website ➡️ Google sites  

## Overview of different website builders

The following recommendations are sorted into groups for what you might be looking for.

### Documentation pages & knowledge bases

These tools focus on providing a simple way to build content-heavy documentation sites. They use complex web frameworks that you can utilize to customize as needed, or you can keep it simple and follow the setup and then write your content in markdown files.

### Beginner-friendly builders

These tools are especially simple to use but come at the cost of customization. They are also typically more expensive.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Squarespace | One of the easiest ways to create a website.  | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | High monthly subscription |
| Wix | One of the easiest ways to create a website. | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | High monthly subscription |
| Google Sites | Very simple but also quite limited. | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐ | Free |
| Hostinger Website Builder | Hostinger is a host provider, but they also have their own website builder. | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | Monthly subscription |
| Wordpress | Very popular. Wordpress has multiple visual builders, like Gutenberg, Elementor or beaverbuilder. The theme and plugin ecosystem is large. | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | Monthly subscription or self-hostable |

If you want a store page Shopify is a popular option. For eCommerce activity and selling things online there is also WooCommerce which is a Wordpress plugin.

This list could continue almost endlessly, but in summary, simple tools above with high ease-of-use will be better for you if you quickly need a website that you can maintain yourself without much expertise and upfront costs at the cost of customizability and things like ownership or search engine optimization (SEO).

## Custom coding

If you want full control over your website you will have to go with coding it yourself. 

Even when it comes to custom coding your own webpage there are many tools available. But at the core of every website lies HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

For knowledge bases, like this page (webdev.bryanhogan.com), I like Starlight. I own all my content and I have full control since it is just using Astro.  
For creating static pages like my [personal blog](https://bryanhogan.com/) I used Astro as well. If I need some interactive behaviour I add Svelte to Astro, Astro allows you to use Svelte components.  
For highly interactive apps I use SvelteKit.
