title: Website Builders
description: Different ways to build a website, from simple builders to custom coding.

import { LinkCard, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Since there are various needs when it comes to having and building a website, I want to highlight that developing your own website from scratch might not always be the best option for your situation.

The three main ways to build a website are:

1.  **Website builders** (Simple, fast, less customizable)
2.  **Content management systems (CMS)** (Manageable content, plugin ecosystems)
3.  **Custom coded** (Complex, full freedom, optimization)

## Quick Recommendations

* **Online Shop:** ➡️ Shopify or WooCommerce
* **Visual freedom:** ➡️ Webflow, Framer, Builder.io or Figma Sites
* **Newsletter focus:** ➡️ Substack, Beehiiv, or Buttondown
* **Simplest possible setup:** ➡️ Google Sites
* **Quick blog:** ➡️ BearBlog, Obsidan Quartz or Leaflet

## 1. Beginner-friendly builders

These tools are especially simple to use but come at the cost of customization. They are also typically more expensive. Best for people who need a website quickly and don't want think about the design or code at all.

## 4. Visual site builders

A visual site builder gives you a high degree of freedom when it comes to creating the interface, without writing CSS. But you are locked into a specific provider, and the more custom of a design you want, the more relevant knowing HTML & CSS becomes.

<CardGrid>
    <LinkCard
        title="Webflow"
        href="https://webflow.com/"
        description="Ease: Moderate | Cost: Monthly subscription <br/> Create websites using Figma like interface."
        target="_blank"
    />
    <LinkCard
        title="Framer"
        href="https://www.framer.com/"
        description="Ease: Moderate | Cost: Monthly subscription <br/> Create websites using Figma like interface."
        target="_blank"
    />
    <LinkCard
        title="Builder.io"
        href="https://www.builder.io/"
        description="Ease: Moderate | Cost: Monthly subscription <br/> A drag-and-drop builder that works with code-based frameworks for more flexibility."
        target="_blank"
    />
    <LinkCard
        title="WebStudio"
        href="https://webstudio.is/"
        description="Ease: Moderate | Cost: Monthly subscription or free <br/> An open-source visual builder that offers a free self-hosted option."
        target="_blank"
    />
    <LinkCard
        title="Figma Sites"
        href="https://www.figma.com/sites/"
        description="Ease: Moderate | Cost: Monthly subscription <br/> Takes designs in Figma, the visual design tool, to create a website."
        target="_blank"
    />

## 5. Documentation pages & knowledge bases

These tools focus on providing a simple way to build content-heavy documentation sites. They use complex web frameworks that you can utilize to customize as needed, or you can keep it simple and follow the setup and then write your content in markdown files.

<CardGrid>
    <LinkCard
        title="Starlight"
        href="https://starlight.astro.build/"
        description="Ease: Moderate | Cost: Free <br/> Create documentation sites using Markdown. Utilizing Astro."
        target="_blank"
    />
    <LinkCard

        description="Ease: Moderate | Cost: Free <br/> Create documentation sites using Markdown. Utilizing Vue."
        target="_blank"
    />

## 6. Custom coding

*Best for: Full control, performance optimization, and unique functionality.*

If you want absolute freedom, you have to code it yourself. At the core, this means HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**My Personal Stack:**
* **Knowledge Bases:** For sites like this page, I use **Starlight**.
* **Static Pages:** For my [personal blog](https://bryanhogan.com/), I also use **Astro**.
* **Interactive:** If I need complex behavior, I add **Svelte** components.
* **Web Apps:** For highly interactive applications, I move to **SvelteKit**.
