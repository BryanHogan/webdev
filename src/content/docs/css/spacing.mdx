<div style="position: relative; width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; max-height: 500px;" class="not-content">
    <iframe 
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" 
        src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9ElrcTtAxzA?si=MihAf3bZyFS1x1j4" 
        title="YouTube video player" 
        frameborder="0" 
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" 
        referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" 
        allowfullscreen 
        loading="lazy" 
        sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-presentation">
    </iframe>
</div>

Except for the ad filled ending this guide by Chainlift is very helpful (don't rely on other proprietary tools for something you can easily do yourself).

Define your spacing values like described in [CSS Variables](/css/variables). Then apply them like mentioned in the video.
