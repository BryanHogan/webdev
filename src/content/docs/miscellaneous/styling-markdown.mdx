Writing blog posts in markdown is great. It's simple and fast.  
Markdown is a simple way to write text using common symbols to add things like \*\***bold**\*\*, \**italics*\*, or lists.

Many webpages have their content written in markdown. The markdown content gets then transformed into HTML that is displayed on the website. But when you are building your own website you will also want to style that content, so how could that look like?

## On styling content written in markdown
There are multiple ways you can approach styling your own markdown content.

- Using a package such as [Tailwind Typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography) with pre-defined styling. Here's a [list of other drop-in CSS frameworks](https://github.com/swyxio/spark-joy/blob/master/README.md#drop-in-css-frameworks) you could use.
- Writing your own CSS.

Because I'd like my written contents design to fit into the rest of the page I like to write my own styles. This is a bit of work though as we have to write styling for the various elements that markdown allows us to create.

Part of your styling such as `<p>` and `<h1>` elements might already have styling defined in your main CSS file that you can continue to use. But markdown content can also include images, code blocks, quotes and more.
