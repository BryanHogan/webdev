import { Card, CardGrid, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Reference pages are ideal for outlining how things work in terse and clear terms.
Less concerned with telling a story or addressing a specific use case, they should give a comprehensive outline of what you're documenting.

## Further reading

- Read [Starlight Documentation](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/components/) about cool stuff I can do in MDX files. This also includes all the [icons](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/components/#icon).
- I can also referene [something](#nice) here. Path name reference example look can be here check it `src/content/docs` thanks.

:::note
This is a note that also includes some code

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template starlight
```

:::


```js
// my-test-file.js
console.log('Hello World!');
```
