## About Bryan's Web Dev Guide

WebDev.BryanHogan.com is a comprehensive guide on how to create modern websites using the underlying technologies of all website, basic HTML and CSS.

This WebDev guide focusses on the following values:
- Fast and performant web pages
- Providing a high quality user experience (UX)
- Websites that can scale and exist long-term
- Great accessibility

By understanding HTML, CSS and JavaScript a front-end developer can build any website using any well-built web technology.

For each website I build I need similar things. And instead of copying over these from the last project to the next I decided to built this page to store & show-off that knowledge and content. To have one comprehensive place that combines it.
