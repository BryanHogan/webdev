<Card title="Hi there! ðŸ‘‹">
Goal of this page was to make a comprehensive guide to things that go into building a quality web page. I personally use it every time I build a new website.

Focus was not to rewrite existing content but instead bundle other contents key points and leave references where they are useful.
